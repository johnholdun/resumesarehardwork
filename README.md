# Resumes Are Hard Work

## Content and Deploying

This site uses [Prismic](https://prismic.io).

TODO: Figure out how to export the custom type for future use. This might only be available with a paid plan.

1. Set environment variables for Prismic
2. Run `yarn build`
3. Your site's files will be generated in `public/`
